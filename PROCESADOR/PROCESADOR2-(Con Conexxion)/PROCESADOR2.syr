PACKER Warning: Lut Inst_ALU/salidaALU_mux00072 is driving XOR and other loads hence can not be packed with the XOR/Carry. This would result in an extra LUT for a feedthrough.

(*) This 1 clock signal(s) are generated by combinatorial logic,

Please use the CLOCK_SIGNAL constraint to specify the clock signal(s) generated by combinatorial logic.
INFO:Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
